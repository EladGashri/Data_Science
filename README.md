Data exploration and visualization. 

Preprocessing the train data: feature engineering, outliers removal, handling missing values and categorical features, data scailing and dimensionality reduction.

Performing 4 machine learning models on the train data, using the validation set to choose the best hyperparameters that will prevent overfitting and evaluation of the models using K-fold cross validations and ROC curves.

Using the model with the best results to prefict the test data.

Project done with Python on Jupyter notebook.
